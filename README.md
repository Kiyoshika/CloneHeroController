# CloneHeroController
A small project (generated by STM32CubeMX) for building a mini physical controller for playing the game Clone Hero.

This is a very barebones keyboard driver mapped to 5 buttons, D, F, J, K, L which I use as the keys in Clone Hero.

# Board Design

I assembled a bread board with 5 buttons and 5 LEDs.

The buttons are connected to 5 pins on a STM32F411xx microcontroller.

Mapping:
* Green - PB9
* Red - PB5
* Yellow - PB3
* Blue - PA1
* Orange - PB7
